node_modules
dist
# donâ€™t need to track the contents of node_modules with git, 
#  nor push those files to GitHub. 
# package.json file contains all the dependency information!!!!!!!!
# so that anyone can clone  project and install them on their machine
#  w npm install

# dist can also be igored: it can be generated when someone 
# runs the command to bundle/build the application.
